```

In this example:

- **`computer_shop/`**: The root folder of the project.

- **`app/`**: Contains folders with application source code.

  - **`controllers/`**: This folder contains controllers for each main entity of the application. Each file, such as `address.controller.js` or `client.controller.js`, handles business logic related to these entities.

  - **`models/`**: This folder is used to define data models representing the application's entities. The `index.js` file typically configures and associates the models

 with the database, while individual files, such as `address.model.js` and `client.model.js`, define the attributes and relationships of the entities.

  - **`routes/`**: Application routes are defined here. Each file, such as `address.routes.js` or `client.routes.js`, specifies routes related to a specific entity and the controllers to be called when these routes are accessed.

  - **`config/`**: Typically contains application-specific configurations, such as database configurations. The `db.config.js` file likely contains database connection information.

- **`.gitignore`**: This file specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by the Git version control system. This usually includes temporary or sensitive files that should not be tracked.

- **`package.json`**: It is the Node.js manifest file that lists the project's dependencies and other information, such as execution scripts.

- **`package-lock.json`**: This file is automatically generated and contains detailed information about the versions of project dependencies, ensuring consistent installation across different environments.

- **`README.md`**: Typically, this is a documentation file that provides information about the project, such as installation, configuration, and usage instructions.

- **`server.js`**: This is the entry point of the application. It typically configures the web server and starts the application.

This directory structure follows a typical organization of Node.js projects with Express.js, where source code is divided into controllers, models, and routes for better modularity and maintenance. Additionally, configuration files and the manifest file are used to configure the application and manage dependencies.
